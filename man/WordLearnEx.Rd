\description{
Accuracy in 2-alternative forced-choice word learning experiment. On each trial, participants see two complex geometric shapes, hear a novel word (e.g., "pibu"), and have to guess which object corresponds to the word. They receive feedback and gradually learn which object goes with which word. There are 6 trials in each of the 10 training blocks. Transitional probability of the novel words (i.e., p("bu"|"pi")) was experimentally manipulated (between-subjects) during an exposure phase immediately preceding the word learning phase.
