#' Effect of transitional probability on novel word learning
#' 
#' Accuracy in 2-alternative forced-choice word learning experiment. On each trial, participants see two complex geometric shapes, hear a novel word (e.g., "pibu"), and have to guess which object corresponds to the word. They receive feedback and gradually learn which object goes with which word. There are 6 trials in each of the 10 training blocks. Transitional probability of the novel words (i.e., p("bu"|"pi")) was experimentally manipulated (between-subjects) during an exposure phase immediately preceding the word learning phase.

#' Peer influence on adolescent risk-taking
#' 
#' Invented risk-taking data in peer and no-peer contexts for adolescents with high or low resistance to peer influence. In this hypothetical experiment, adolescents came to the laboratory and completed different risk-taking scenarios, which either involved a peer context or a no-peer context. (Note: some data are missing because not all participants completed all items). The participants also completed a standard measure of resistance to peer influence and those scores were used to divide participants into High and Low groups by median split.
